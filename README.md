Here’s a clean `README.md` for the **root of your repo** that explains the structure and points users to the frontend and backend setup guides:

```markdown
# Meal Calorie App

This repository contains both the **backend** and **frontend** of the Meal Calorie application.  
Each part of the project has its own `README.md` with detailed setup instructions.

👉 This way, someone opening your repo knows immediately:
- That both frontend & backend exist inside.
- Where to look for the setup instructions.
- How to clone and start.  

Do you also want me to create **individual `README.md` templates** for `frontend/` and `backend/` with step-by-step setup (npm install, uvicorn, etc.)?
